                <div class="accordion-content"> <p>There are new privacy settings to give you greater control over which applications can access the list of Wi-Fi networks in your vicinity, which could potentially be used to pinpoint your location. You can review and adjust app permissions by going to <span class="highlight">Settings > Privacy & security > Location</span>.</p>
        
                    <p>To simplify the process of sharing your location with trusted applications, we've implemented a new prompt. This prompt appears the first time an application attempts to access your location or Wi-Fi details, enabling location services and granting the app permission to use your location data. This facilitates tasks like finding directions or checking the weather without the need to delve into Settings.</p>
                    
                    <p>Moreover, the prompt alerts you when an application unexpectedly requests access to location services, allowing you to deny permission if needed. If you prefer to keep your location private, you can disable <span class="highlight">Notify when apps request location</span> in the location settings to prevent these prompts from appearing when location services are turned off.</p>
                    
                    <p>Once permission is granted, applications utilizing location or Wi-Fi data are listed under <span class="highlight">Recent activity</span> on the Location page. Additionally, a location icon will be displayed in the taskbar while the app is active, helping you monitor when and how apps are accessing this information.</p></div>
